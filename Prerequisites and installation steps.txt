
1. Initialization and Setup
WiFi Setup:
Connects the ESP32 to a WiFi network. The credentials are provided in the ssid and pass variables.
Sensors Initialization:
Initializes all connected sensors (DHT22 for humidity and temperature, BMP280 for pressure and altitude, ML8511 for UV intensity, and the rain and wind sensors).
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following:

Hardware Components:

ESP32 microcontroller
DHT22 sensor (for humidity and temperature)
BMP280 sensor (for pressure and temperature)
ML8511 sensor (for UV intensity)
Rain sensor module
Anemometer (for wind speed)
Connecting wires and breadboard/power supply
Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE (latest version)
ThingSpeak account (for data visualization)
Installed drivers for ESP32 board
Libraries:

WiFi.h
HTTPClient.h
ThingSpeak.h
Adafruit_BMP280.h
DHT.h


////Installation Steps
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Install Arduino IDE
Download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
Install the IDE based on your operating system.

2. Set Up the ESP32 Board
Open Arduino IDE and go to File > Preferences.
Add the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:
arduino
Copy code
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager and search for ESP32.
Install the ESP32 package.

3. Install Required Libraries
Open Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search and install the following libraries:
DHT sensor library by Adafruit
Adafruit BMP280 Library
ThingSpeak
Ensure WiFi.h and HTTPClient.h are included (default libraries with ESP32).

4. Connect Hardware
Refer to the Hardware Connections section in this README to wire up all the sensors to the ESP32.

5. Configure the Code
Open the WeatherStation.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Update the following parameters in the code:
WiFi Credentials:
cpp
Copy code
const char *ssid = "Your WiFi SSID";
const char *pass = "Your WiFi Password";
ThingSpeak Credentials:
cpp
Copy code
#define Channel_ID <Your Channel ID>
#define API_Key "<Your ThingSpeak API Key>"

6. Upload the Code
Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
Select the correct board and port:
Board: ESP32 Dev Module
Port: Check under Tools > Port.
Click the Upload button in the Arduino IDE.

7. Monitor Serial Output
Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl + Shift + M or Tools > Serial Monitor).
Set the baud rate to 115200 to view the sensor readings and WiFi connection status.
How the System Works
WiFi Connection:
The ESP32 connects to a WiFi network using credentials defined in the ssid and pass variables.

Sensor Data Reading:
Sensors are periodically read in the loop() function, and the following data is collected:

Temperature, Pressure, Humidity
UV Intensity, Rainfall, Wind Speed
Data Processing:
Raw values from sensors are processed into meaningful measurements, such as UV intensity or rainfall in mm.

Data Upload:
Sensor readings are uploaded to ThingSpeak cloud service for visualization and analysis.

Dependencies
Libraries:
WiFi.h
HTTPClient.h
ThingSpeak.h
Adafruit_BMP280.h
DHT.h
Install all dependencies using the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

1. Install WiFi.h Library
This library comes pre-installed with the ESP32 board package.

Steps:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Ensure youâ€™ve installed the ESP32 board package:
Go to File > Preferences.
Add the following URL to the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field:
arduino
Copy code
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for ESP32, and click Install.
The WiFi.h library will be automatically included when you select an ESP32 board.

2. Install HTTPClient.h Library
Like WiFi.h, this library is included with the ESP32 board package.

Steps:

Ensure the ESP32 board package is installed as described above.
The HTTPClient.h library is included by default with ESP32 support.


3. Install ThingSpeak.h Library
This library allows interaction with the ThingSpeak platform.

Steps:

Open Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
In the search bar, type ThingSpeak.
Locate the library developed by MathWorks.
Click Install.


4. Install Adafruit_BMP280.h Library
This library enables communication with the BMP280 pressure and temperature sensor.

Steps:

Open Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
In the search bar, type Adafruit BMP280.
Locate the library by Adafruit.
Click Install.


5. Install DHT.h Library
This library is used for reading data from the DHT22 sensor.

Steps:

Open Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
In the search bar, type DHT sensor library.
Locate the library by Adafruit.
Click Install.

Verification
After installing these libraries:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library.
Check the dropdown menu to confirm that the installed libraries appear in the list.
